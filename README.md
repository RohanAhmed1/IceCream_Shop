Fist time practice with front end of html and css.

the div concept is very important for arranging html contents.

the outer div is very iomportant of the size of the width of the screen

text-align ,color, align-oitems ,etc will also apply on div item. I mean some statemnts work on div while some also on div items

flex will take space in column while block in row
